# THE MEOW LANG API

src - contains all the function defination decleared in include <br />

# MEOW.C
meow.c is the entry point (the main.c file if you will). <br/>

# TODO
`ast_gen.c` need work current implementation does not work.<br/>
`lexer.c` - some how works but still need improvement.<br/>

My plan is to make every data structure that will be used in this project from stratch.<br/>
all my build data structure is in `src/DS/`.<br/>
They work but can be improved.
