# BUILD DEV (very early stages)

# GETTING STARTED

# ❗❗Caution❗❗
I use ubuntu, this steps might not work on windows or mac systems.

`fork this repo`<br />
`git clone https://github.com/<your-user-name>/meow-lang`<br />
`make create`<br />
`make libs`<br />
`make bin-debug` with debug info<br />
`make bin-release` without debug info<br />
`cd build`<br />
`./meowlang main.meow`<br />

# Prerequisites
1 - `make` <br />
3 - `g++/clang++` <br />

# PLAN
step 1 - Put the whole file in buffer so it is easier to work with.<br>
step 2 - Lexer will work with this buffer to produce tokens<br>
step 3 - read the tokenized list and generate a AST and check of syntax errors<br>
step 4 - read the AST and execute code according to it<br>


# TODO📋
[ PARTIALLY DONE ] - Read the whole file and put it into buffer for easy operations <br />
[ PARTIALLY DONE ] - Read the buffer and tokenize it <br />
[ PARTIALLY DONE ] - Write all the tokes<br />
[ PARTIALLY DONE ] - Make a tree structure for the AST (Abstract syntax tree)<br />
[ PARTIALLY DONE ] - Make a parser thats read the tokenized list and generates a AST <br />
[ PARTIALLY DONE ] - Syntax check and all <br />
[ PARTIALLY DONE ] - traverse the AST and execute it <br />
